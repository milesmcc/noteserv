# noteserv
Intranote searching for Evernote for the Daily Log.

## Installation
Make sure all the notes have the primary identifier before the first `|` in their title. Also be sure to specify which notebook to search in the configuration, located in `~/.noteserv`.

## Further help
Because this is a very niche program, I haven't invested much time into expanding its configuration or documentation. If you'd like to use noteserv yourself, send me a message at `noteserv-outreach@sendmiles.email`.
